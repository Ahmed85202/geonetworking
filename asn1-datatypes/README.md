# ASN.1 Datatypes

Java annotations to augment Java classes with information from [ASN.1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One) specifications. These annotations can later be used by encoders like [asn1-uper](https://github.com/alexvoronov/geonetworking/tree/master/asn1-uper).

### Status

Datatypes are enough to handle [camdenm](https://github.com/alexvoronov/geonetworking/tree/master/camdenm). There is no compiler yet, so Java classes and annotations have to be created and added manually.


### Other ASN.1 tools
ITU-T have a [list of ASN.1 tools](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/asn1/Pages/Tools.aspx).

### Acknowledgments
This implementation was partly developed within [i-GAME](http://gcdc.net/i-game) project that has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no [612035](http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/110506_en.html).

Use of annotations and reflection was inspired by [Gson](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/).
