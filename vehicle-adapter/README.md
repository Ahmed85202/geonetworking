# Vehicle Adapter

This is the Chalmers team vehicle adapter that connects the GeoNetworking stack to the vehicle control system implemented in [Simulink](http://se.mathworks.com/products/simulink/). The vehicle control system communicates with the GeoNetworking stack via UDP, using the [Chalmers local message set](https://github.com/Zeverin/GCDC16-Chalmers-Communication/tree/master/Documentation).

Both the vehicle adapter and the local message set is still in development and everything is subject to change.
