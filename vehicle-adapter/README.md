# Vehicle Adapter

Here will be the code to connect the GeoNetworking stack to a vehicle control system implemented in [Simulink](http://se.mathworks.com/products/simulink/). Vehicle control system will communicate with GeoNetworking stack via UDP using a custom message format (probably a binary-packed Simulink bus).
